# clearhead-examples
Took a few days to understand what exactly I had to do to create these deliverables (don't know why!!), but I figured it out.

##V1

V1 has been a bit challenging, since there's more HTML and CSS to create. 

With the original code not being available to me, I'm not exactly sure how to pull a picture.

Currently I'm working on getting the slide out to work. Some elements within the #topCartContent div are not coming along for the ride.

##V2

Not sure how to condense the CSS or HTML, was very concerned with getting it looking right.


Another issue (at least what I believe to be an issue) is with my if statement. It was the only way I could think to tell if someone had something in their cart or not, without having the rest of the code available.
