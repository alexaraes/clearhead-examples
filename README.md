# clearhead-examples

Took a few days to understand what exactly I had to do to create these deliverables (don't know why!!), but I figured it out.
Not sure how to condense the CSS or HTML, was very concerned with getting it looking right.
Another issue (at least what I believe to be an issue) is with my if statement. It was the only way I could think to tell if someone had something in their cart or not, without having the rest of the code available.
