Took a few days to understand what exactly I had to do to create these deliverables (don't know why!!), but I figured it out.

##V1

This one was super difficult because CSS is a meanie.

I coded out the HTML and CSS first to get the styling looking right, and then injected it all into my jQuery and that was a huge mistake.

Also it took me forever to find the right combination of values for the .animate().

I most definitely could have made some variables for my selectors but my wrist just popped in a way I've never heard before.

BUT, all in all I'm proud of it, and I hope it's close to what you wanted to see from me!


##V2

Not sure how to condense the CSS or HTML, was very concerned with getting it looking right.


Another issue (at least what I believe to be an issue) is with my if statement. It was the only way I could think to tell if someone had something in their cart or not, without having the rest of the code available.
