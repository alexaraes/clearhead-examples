Took a few days to understand what exactly I had to do to create these deliverables (don't know why!!), but I figured it out.

##V1

This one was super difficult because CSS is a meanie.

I coded out the HTML and CSS first to get the styling looking right, and then injected it all into my jQuery and that was a huge mistake.

Also it took me forever to find the right combination of values for the .animate().

I most definitely could have made some variables for my selectors but my wrist just popped in a way I've never heard before.

I added in a little slide-out effect too, just for consistency. Also, I really wanted to do this cool little animated x that just twists 90 degrees on hover, but it had a lot of pseudo element stuff that even if I could have put it in my jQuery, it would have almost doubled my code! Take my word for it, it would have looked hella cool.

BUT, all in all I'm proud of it, and I hope it's close to what you wanted to see from me!


##V2

Not sure how to condense the CSS or HTML, was very concerned with getting it looking right.


Another issue (at least what I believe to be an issue) is with my if statement. It was the only way I could think to tell if someone had something in their cart or not, without having the rest of the code available.
